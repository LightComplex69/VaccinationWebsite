    <h1>If You Don't Get Vaxed, Corona Will Come Back! </h1>
    <h1></h1>
    <h1></h1>
    <p>We as a community have noticed that the number of vaccinations isn't as
      high as it should be especially during this unsure time and as a result we
      have decided to take it upon ourselves to try and encourage the amount of
      vaccinations in any way we can. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <h2>Why Get Vaxed?</h2>
    <h1></h1>
    <h1></h1>
    <p>Many people refuse to get vaccinated due to the fact they believe that it
      is unsafe for them and their children as well as in some cases that it is
      unsanitary, or simply goes against their religious or political beliefs.
      However because of such criticism we are here to shed some light on the
      covid vaccine and why everyone should get vaccinated. Like any other
      vaccine it injects a tiny part of the virus into our bodies in order to
      help build or immunity towards the virus itself, by teaching our immune
      systems how to fight and recognize covid the chances of us falling ill to
      covid become slim. And surely after your second dose your body will have
      built protection against the virus and will be able to go out and about
      without need for a mask or worry of falling ill.&nbsp; </p>

    <h1></h1>
    <p>Some common myths about the covid vaccine are for example that it gives
      you covid which is entirely incorrect, it is not possible for the vaccine
      to give you covid as none of the vaccines contain a real piece of real
      corona virus. Another myth that was popular was that it could make someone
      infertile as there has been no actual evidence that any people who took it
      lost any fertility because of the vaccine.</p>
    <p><strong>Ultimately there is no reason for you not to get the vaccine, and
        if more people were to get vaccinated then the population can be
        considered protected and have population immunity and the chances that
        covid would multiple or mutate will be slim.</strong><br>
